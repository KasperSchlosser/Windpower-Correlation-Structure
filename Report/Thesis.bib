  abstract = {The continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) is a frequently used scoring rule. In contrast with many other scoring rules, the CRPS evaluates cumulative distribution functions. An ensemble of forecasts can easily be converted into a piecewise constant cumulative distribution function with steps at the ensemble members. This renders the CRPS a convenient scoring rule for the evaluation of ‘raw’ ensembles, obviating the need for sophisticated ensemble model output statistics or dressing methods prior to evaluation. In this article, a relation between the CRPS score and the quantile score is established. The evaluation of ‘raw’ ensembles using the CRPS is discussed in this light. It is shown that latent in this evaluation is an interpretation of the ensemble as quantiles but with non-uniform levels. This needs to be taken into account if the ensemble is evaluated further, for example with rank histograms. Copyright © 2012 Royal Meteorological Society},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting involves justifying assertions scientifically regarding potential states or predicting future trends of an event based on historical data recorded at various time intervals. The field of time series forecasting, supported by diverse deep learning models, has made significant advancements, rendering it a prominent research area. The broad spectra of available time series datasets serve as valuable resources for conducting extensive studies in time series analysis with varied objectives. However, the complexity and scale of time series data present challenges in constructing reliable prediction models. In this paper, our objectives are to introduce and review methodologies for modeling time series data, outline the commonly used time series forecasting datasets and different evaluation metrics. We delve into the essential architectures for trending an input dataset and offer a comprehensive assessment of the recently developed deep learning prediction models. In general, different models likely serve different design goals. We boldly examine the performance of these models under the same time series input dataset with an identical hardware computing system. The measured performance may reflect the design flexibility among all the ranked models. And through our experiments, the SCINet model performs the best in accuracy with the ETT energy input dataset. The results we obtain could give a glimpse in understanding the model design and performance relationship. Upon concluding the paper, we shall provide further discussion on future deep learning research directions in the realm of time series forecasting.},

  abstract = {Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},

In retail businesses, for example, probabilistic demand forecasts are crucial for having the right inventory available at the right time and in the right place. This paper proposes DeepAR, a methodology for producing accurate probabilistic forecasts, based on training an autoregressive recurrent neural network model on a large number of related time series. We demonstrate how the application of deep learning techniques to forecasting can overcome many of the challenges that are faced by widely-used classical approaches to the problem. By means of extensive empirical evaluations on several real-world forecasting datasets, we show that our methodology produces more accurate forecasts than other state-of-the-art methods, while requiring minimal manual work.},

  abstract = {Proper scoring rules provide a theoretically principled framework for the quantitative assessment of the predictive performance of probabilistic forecasts. While a wide selection of such scoring rules for univariate quantities exists, there are only few scoring rules for multivariate quantities, and many of them require that forecasts are given in the form of a probability density function. The energy score, a multivariate generalization of the continuous ranked probability score, is the only commonly used score that is applicable in the important case of ensemble forecasts, where the multivariate predictive distribution is represented by a finite sample. Unfortunately, its ability to detect incorrectly specified correlations between the components of the multivariate quantity is somewhat limited. In this paper the authors present an alternative class of proper scoring rules based on the geostatistical concept of variograms. The sensitivity of these variogram-based scoring rules to incorrectly predicted means, variances, and correlations is studied in a number of examples with simulated observations and forecasts; they are shown to be distinctly more discriminative with respect to the correlation structure. This conclusion is confirmed in a case study with postprocessed wind speed forecasts at five wind park locations in Colorado.},

Hence, it is critical to choose the most appropriate activation function in neural networks calculation. Acharya et al. (2018) suggest that numerous recipes have been formulated over the years, though some of them are considered deprecated these days since they are unable to operate properly under some conditions. These functions have a variety of characteristics, which are deemed essential to successfully learning. Their monotonicity, individual derivatives, and finite of their range are some of these characteristics (Bach 2017). This research paper will evaluate the commonly used additive functions, such as swish, ReLU, Sigmoid, and so forth. This will be followed by their properties, own cons and pros, and particular formula application recommendations.},

The book demonstrates how HMMs can be applied to a wide range of types of time series: continuous-valued, circular, multivariate, binary, bounded and unbounded counts, and categorical observations. It also discusses how to employ the freely available computing environment R to carry out the computations.
