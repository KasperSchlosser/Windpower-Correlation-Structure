\section{Consistent Scoring Functions}
\label{evaluation:scores}


As it is not always feasible to determine the entire distribution, point estimates should also be evaluated.

A scoring function is a scoring function that takes a point forecast, e.g. the mean, median, 95\% quantile, etc., and observation, giving a score.

\begin{equation}
    S: \Omega \times \Omega \rightarrow\mathbb{R}
\end{equation}

A consistent scoring function is a scoring function in which the true point estimate, $t$, has the lowest expected score.  \cite{gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007}

\begin{equation}
    E_{y \sim P}[S(t,y)] \leq E_{y \sim P}[S(x,y)],\quad\forall x \in \Omega
\end{equation}

like with the scoring rules a strictly consistent scoring rule is one where equality only holds for the true point estimate:

\begin{equation}
    E_{y \sim P}[S(t,y)] = E_{y \sim P}[S(x,y)] \iff t = x
\end{equation}

Examples of consistent scoring functions include \gls{mae}, \gls{rmse},\gls{qs}. all three of which is used in this project.
