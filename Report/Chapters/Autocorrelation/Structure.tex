For modelling the autocorrelation of the forecasts, the idea was to use the same principle as copulas, described in \cref{Pseudo}. 

The forecast had varied and widely different marginal structures, making it unlikely that a theoretical model could be constructed to describe the process.

In pseudo-residual space, all observations should ideally have the same normal distribution. 

It should be possible to model the correlation in this space.

As an example of the, an \gls{ar}(1) process has a normal marginal distribution. using the same principle of copulas the process can be translated to into any marginal distribution.

In \cref{fig:autocorrelation:correlation} an \gls{ar}(1) process with autoregressive parameter $\alpha = 0.99$ and noise term $\sigma^2 = 1- \alpha^2 = 0.01 $ is simulated and transformed into a log-uniform distribution.

It is still clear from the transformed process that some sort of correlation structure exists.

From \cref{fig:autocorrelation:margin}, it is also clear that the marginal distribution is in fact a logarithmic uniform distribution.

The ideas explored in this chapter seem to have some precedent; \textcite{wilsonCopulaProcesses2010} examined the construction of correlated processes using copulas on Gaussian processes. However, further literature is sparse.
