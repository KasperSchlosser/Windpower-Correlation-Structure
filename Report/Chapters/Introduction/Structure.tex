The general electricity systems of the world have evolved significantly in the last 20 years. Liberalisation of electricity markets, as well as the development of renewable energy solutions, has significantly impacted the operations of national energy grids. \cite{castro2024a}\cite{europeancommission.directorategeneralforeconomicandfinancialaffairs.DevelopmentRenewableEnergy2023}

Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, tend to exhibit much higher volatility compared to traditional power sources \cite{castro2024a}.

This higher volatility increases the difficulty operating, planning, and balancing the energy production in the grid, and increases the demand for good forecasts.
Good forecasts helps in planning production, reducing the need for expensive regulation, and reducing the risk of brown or blackouts.\cite{castro2024a}

Electricity in particular has had a dramatic increase in usage of renewable sources, accounting for 45\% or all electricity in 2023\cite{europeancommission.directorategeneralforeconomicandfinancialaffairs.DevelopmentRenewableEnergy2023}, see \cref{fig:renewable-power}
