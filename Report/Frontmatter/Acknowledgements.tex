\section*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my advisors: Jan Kloppenborg Møller, Bastian Schmidt Jørgensen, and Uffe Høgsbro Thygesen. Both for the project and for their support during the project.

A special thanks to Bastian for continuing support even with when a career change meant he had to use his own personal time on it, the help was very much appreciated.

I would also like to thank my colleagues at NNE for the interest and good discussions during the project. 

I would especially like to thank friend and colleague Thomas Bladt, your direct and honest feedback definitely improved the project.
