This thesis investigates the use of pseudo-residuals as a method for modelling correlation structures. 

The primary goal was to model the correlation structure of wind power-production forecasts for four different sources in Denmark.

The goal was accomplished, with an improvement in the relevant score of 17\%-19\% over the base marginal forecast, or up to 33\%-51\% improvement over the raw forecast used.

The conclusion of the project is that pseudo-residuals provides a simple and fast way of modelling correlation structures, that would otherwise be difficult to model.
